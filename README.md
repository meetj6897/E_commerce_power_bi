## E-commerce Inventory Management & Forecasting Dashboard
This project aims to provide a comprehensive solution for visualizing inventory and stock-out information to facilitate effective management in the realm of E-commerce.

### Objective
The primary objective of this project is to develop an interactive and informative dashboard that enables users to gain insights into inventory management and forecasting. By leveraging data visualization techniques, we aim to provide a user-friendly tool that aids in making informed decisions regarding inventory levels, stock-outs, and proactive planning.

### Features
Classification Using **ABC and XYZ Classifiers**: The inventory data has been classified using the ABC and XYZ classifiers based on their importance and variability using DAX. This classification helps in prioritizing inventory management efforts.
ABC classification, also known as the ABC analysis or the Pareto analysis, is a method used to categorize items in inventory based on their value or importance. The classification is based on the Pareto principle, which states that a small percentage of items contribute to a large percentage of the overall value. In an inventory context, it means that a small number of items are responsible for the majority of the inventory's value XYZ classification is another inventory management technique that categorizes items based on their demand patterns or variability. The classification helps organizations determine the appropriate inventory management strategies for different types of items
Both ABC and XYZ classifications provide valuable insights into inventory management, helping organizations make informed decisions about stock levels, ordering frequency, and storage methods based on the characteristics of the items in their inventory

Immersive Dashboard: The dashboard is designed to provide an immersive experience, featuring a variety of visual elements such as **cards, tables, area charts, gauges, and donut charts**. These elements collectively offer a holistic view of inventory-related metrics.

**Moving Average Forecasting**: The dashboard incorporates a moving average forecasting technique for weekly sales and profit. This interactive forecasting is powered by **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** to provide insights for proactive planning and decision-making.
